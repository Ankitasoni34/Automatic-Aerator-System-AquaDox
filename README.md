# Automatic Aerator System (AquaDox)

AquaDox is an intelligent, battery-powered aerator system designed to optimize water quality in aquaculture. It actively monitors dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and temperature, automatically adjusting aeration to maintain ideal conditions for aquatic life. With integrated Bluetooth connectivity, users can conveniently control and monitor the system remotely via a mobile application. This project promotes sustainable aquaculture by reducing energy consumption and ensuring healthier aquatic environments.
