# Automatic Aerator System (AquaDox)

Project Proposed for Project-Exhibition-1 Conducted by VIT BHOPAL UNIVERSITY

# 🐟Automatic Aerator System (AquaDox)

## 📌Project Overview
AquaDox is an intelligent, battery-powered aerator system designed to optimize water quality in aquaculture. It actively monitors dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and temperature, automatically adjusting aeration to maintain ideal conditions for aquatic life. With integrated Bluetooth connectivity, users can conveniently control and monitor the system remotely via a mobile application. This project promotes sustainable aquaculture by reducing energy consumption and ensuring healthier aquatic environments.

## 🌟Features
🔋 Battery-Powered: Eco-friendly operation, reducing reliance on grid electricity.

📱 Bluetooth Control: Remote monitoring & management via a mobile app for convenience.

💧 Water Quality Monitoring: Tracks Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, and Temperature in real-time. 

⚙️ Automated Aeration: Intelligently maintains optimal DO levels with minimal human intervention.

🐠 Healthier Aquatic Life: Ensures a stable and healthy environment for aquatic organisms.

💡 Energy Efficient: Designed to minimize power consumption for sustainable use.

## ⚙️Tech Stack
**Hardware**: Sensors (Dissolved Oxygen, Temperature), Microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi)

**Software**: Python/C++, IoT Cloud Integration, Web & Mobile Dashboard

## ✈️Installation & Usage

## 1) Hardware Setup
1. Establish the connection between the dissolved oxygen sensor and the microcontroller unit.
2. Implement the relay module for precise aerator actuation.
3. Initiate power to the system and confirm accurate sensor calibration.
